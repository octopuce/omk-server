## OpenMediaKit Server ##

This is the [Open-MediaKit Server v2.0](http://www.open-mediakit.org/)

The OpenMediaKit Server is a free software to manage your media online.

This part of the OpenMediaKit project is the API Server (video recognition and transcoding)

Its aim is to

* get media files from an [OpenMediaKit-Client](https://github.com/octopuce/omk-client) or any API-compatible application
* extract the metadata of the media (size, codecs, bitrates ...)
* transcode them to other formats (thumbnails, web format, mobile ...)
* send them back to your OpenMediaKit-aware application.

Go to http://www.open-mediakit.org/ for more information, downloads, documentation...

* Installation instructions are in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file
* for a Multi-server instance of the omk-server, read [MULTISERVER.md](MULTISERVER.md)
