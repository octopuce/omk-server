This is Open-MediaKit-transcoder 2.0

The OpenMediaKit-Transcoder is a free software to manage your media online.

This part of the OpenMediaKit project is the TRANSCODER

Its aim is to
* get media files from an OpenMediaKit or any API-compatible application
* extract the metadata of the media (size, codecs, bitrates ...)
* transcode them to other formats (thumbnails, web format, mobile ...)
* send them back to an OpenMediaKit/Other-Application instance.
